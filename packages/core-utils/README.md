This package depends on [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat](`Intl.DateTimeFormat`), which is not supported by older browsers or node versions. [https://caniuse.com/?search=Intl.DateTimeFormat](As can be seen here,) support is fairly signifigant across major browsers. Should older browsers need to be targeted, a polyfill can be added. Such a polyfill is available [https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-datetimeformat/](here).

This package depends on the [https://date-fns.org](date-fns library), which relies on Node version 14 and above. Should this library be used for _server side rendering_, Node version 14 or above must be used.
